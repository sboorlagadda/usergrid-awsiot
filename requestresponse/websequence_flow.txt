title Usergrid + AWS IoT (Request-Response)

Device->+AP: RegisterDevice(serial#, deviceDetails)
note over Device, AP:
Interace between device & AP are out-of-scope 
and a magical interface is assumed.
end note
AP->AP: Generate a unique request Id (Say REQ123).
AP->AWS IoT Device: Subscribe to deviceregistration/response/REQ123
AP->-Device: Return RequestID(REQ123)
AP->+AWS IoT Device: Publish deviceDetails to deviceregistration/request/REQ123
AWS IoT Device->AWS IoT Device: AWS IoT Rule with topic filter deviceregistration/request/+
AWS IoT Device->+AWS Lambda: Invoke DeviceRegistration Function
note right of AWS IoT Device:
AWS Rule matches the published topic 
deviceregistration/request/REQ123
with
deviceregistration/request/+
and invokes the target Lambda function
end note
note right of AWS Lambda:
orgId is available as device attribute
device is mapped to an appId(tenant) using serialnumber<->appId
end note
AWS Lambda->+Usergrid: HTTP POST /orgs/{orgid}/apps/{appid}/devices
Usergrid->-AWS Lambda: HTTP 201 Created, {"deviceid":"UUID"}
AWS Lambda->-AWS IoT Device: Publish response to deviceregistration/response/REQ123
note left of AWS Lambda:
Lambda becomes an mqtt client and publishes to AWS IoT
It uses the source AP certificate.
end note
AWS IoT Device->AP: Publishes out the response
AP->Device:Forward the response to the device
